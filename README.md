# hello-world
Just another (initial) repository!
Always enjoyed learning, and the world of computers provides a seemingly infinite number of opportunities to explore concepts, implementations of those concepts, and applications of those implementations. 
And the seasons they go round and round...
Currently learning MySQL, and Workbench.
Concurrently starting down a path to learn about Data Science and R programming.
And, of course, learning about 'git' and 'github' in order to share.
